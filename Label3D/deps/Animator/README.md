# Animator
`Animator` is a general purpose toolbox for interactive data animation in MATLAB.
It can be used to animate videos and charts with an intuitive user interface.
You can link `Animators` together to build powerful custom interactive visualizations. 
You can also easily write videos with `Animators`, allowing you to share your visualizations with others. 

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/diegoaldarondo/Animator.git
```

## Animated Charts
You can use `Animators` to interactively visualize many types of data. This is done through specialized `Animator` subclasses: 
* VideoAnimator
* ScatterAnimator
* Scatter3Animator
* Keypoint2DAnimator
* DraggableKeypoint2DAnimator
* Keypoint3DAnimator
* TraceAnimator
* StackedTraceAnimator
* QuiverAnimator
* RasterAnimator
* HeatMapAnimator

## Examples
Look at `AnimatorExamples.m` for a guide on how to use different `Animator` classes.
